# Generative Sentiments - NLP Model

This repository holds the jupyter notebook which implements a bidirectional LSTM model used to classify an emotional sentence into one of 6 emotions.

The model is trained off data in the /data .txt files and saved to the sentiment-model directory.

My solution was heavily inpired by [this](https://www.kaggle.com/adithyansukumar/sentiment-analysis) bidirectional LSTM model created by kernel392aeb0326.
